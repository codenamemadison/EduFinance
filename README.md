## Process
To tackle the problem shared among the groupmates of college financial needs, after research into related issues and studying existing products made to help with this problem, we first built a [mock-up in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/bwwuSkIDYUr5Y5vohw4dLK/Wireframe?node-id=0%3A1).

After feedback from our mentors, we made adjustments and eventually coded a web-interactive prototype of what would be the product, in which different members focused on different features of the potential product and what it could look like.
